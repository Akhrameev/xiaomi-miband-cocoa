===================

Access Xiaomi MiBand from OS X via Bluetooth LE.

Note: It might take a while for the Mac to detect MiBand. Keep in mind that MiBand can only be connected / paired to one device at a time, so make sure to disconnect any tablets / phones from MiBand if your Mac can't discover it.
